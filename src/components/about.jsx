                      <strong>Hi, I'm Scott Li.</strong> I am a Software
                      Engineer currently working at Trizetto Healthcare in
                      Colorado, where I design and implement custom software
                      solutions tailored to the needs of healthcare clients.
                      Since joining in January 2023, I have worked across the
                      full software development lifecycle to deliver
                      high-performance, scalable solutions that drive efficiency
                      and improve operational workflows within the healthcare
                      sector.{" "}

                    <p className="aboutLayout">
                      My responsibilities include developing robust automation
                      tools and optimizing complex data processing pipelines
                      using C# and SQL, significantly enhancing system
                      performance and reducing manual effort. I design,
                      implement, and maintain relational SQL databases, ensuring
                      scalability, data integrity, and efficient querying for
                      large-scale healthcare applications processing millions of
                      records.{" "}

                    <p className="aboutLayout">
                      In addition to hands-on development, I collaborate closely
                      with cross-functional teams and clients to understand
                      business needs and translate them into effective technical
                      solutions. I also contribute to technical documentation
                      and best practices to promote maintainability and
                      knowledge sharing within the organization.{" "}

                      I am passionate about process optimization and continuous
                      improvement, having led initiatives that automated key
                      workflows, streamlined data pipelines, and enhanced system
                      reliability. Through efficient software design and
                      thoughtful architecture, I help our clients achieve
                      measurable improvements in operational efficiency and data

                      Outside of work, I enjoy staying active and connected to
                      natureâ€”spending my free time kayaking, paddleboarding,
                      hiking, and snowboarding. I also have a passion for
                      technology at home, where I tinker with my self-built NAS,
                      experiment with optimizing containerized applications, and
                      explore new ways to leverage Docker to improve my home lab
                      environment.
